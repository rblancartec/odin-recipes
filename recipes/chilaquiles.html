    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chilaquiles is a traditional Mexican breakfast dish consisting of corn tortillas cut into quarters and lightly fried.</p>
    <p>Typically, corn tortillas cut into quarters and lightly fried or baked for a lighter version are the basis of the dish. Green or red salsa is poured over the crisp tortilla triangles. The mixture is simmered until the tortilla starts softening. Pulled chicken is sometimes added to the mix. It is commonly garnished with crema, crumbled queso fresco, sliced onion, and avocado slices. Chilaquiles can be served with refried beans, eggs (scrambled or fried) and guacamole as side dishes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 fresh tomatillos, husks removed</li>
        <li>1 white onion, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>1 poblano pepper, peeled and seeded</li>
        <li>1 jalapeno pepper, seeded</li>
        <li>¾ cup chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>2 leaves fresh mint</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded cooked chicken</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>12 (6 inch) white corn tortillas, cut into 3 strips</li>
        <li>¾ cup shredded pepperjack cheese</li>
        <li>¾ cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Blend tomatillos, onion, poblano pepper, jalapeno pepper, cilantro, garlic, mint, and salt in a blender until smooth. Transfer mixture to a saucepan and bring to a gentle boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened, stirring often, about 10 minutes. Add chicken to tomatillo sauce and continue to simmer until chicken is heated through, about 5 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry tortilla strips in batches until crisp and lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        <li>Layer about half the fried tortillas in a 2-quart baking dish; spread half the tomatillo sauce over tortillas. Mix pepperjack cheese and Monterey Jack cheese in a bowl; sprinkle half over tomatillo sauce. Repeat layers.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until cheese is golden and bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow to cool 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
